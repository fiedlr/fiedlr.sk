If you buy an espresso machine and want to get the most out of it, you will start
looking for how-to's on the web. You will soon find out you also need a grinder
and a proper scale. And then most likely you quickly come across the following recipe:

18 grams, 1/2 ratio, 20s-30s time

Although it's pretty straightforward, all sorts of follow-up questions come up.
First of all, it is not at all clear how to achieve this.
Why grams and not dl?
Why is time important if you know the ratio and the input weight?
Why 18 grams if this is actually a recipe for a *double*, and a single basket can only take up to 10 grams?
The interesting concept that connects all of these questions is *extraction theory*.

# Extraction

I would call extraction a measure specifying the intensity of getting
substances from the ground beans to water.
To get the best possible coffee, you want extraction appropriate for the beans.
This might be an oversimplification, but lighter beans need more extraction whereas
darker beans need less extraction -- that is out of our scope here.

One can influence extraction in many ways, with relations given in the following table.
The first two ,
temperature          ... ^
amount of water      ... ^
pressure             ... ^
brew time            ... ^
dose                 ... >
grind size           ... >

# Troubleshooting

Extraction is only useful insofar as it is *consistent* across the entire basket.
It is a measure per particle in the basket.
This is why one needs to ensure an *even* extraction, where
