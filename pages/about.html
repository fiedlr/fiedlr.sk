title: About

<p>
  I studied Theoretical Computer Science at <a href="https://fi.muni.cz">Masaryk University</a>.
  Currently, I'm a Research Engineer at <a href="https://runtimeverification.com/">Runtime Verification Inc.</a>
  We're developing <a href="http://www.matching-logic.org/">matching logic</a>, which is the theoretical foundation of the <a href="https://kframework.org/">K framework.</a>
  This framework allows you to generate all the relevant tools for your programming language <em>automatically</em> and <em>reliably</em>.
</p>

<p>
  My software endeavors can be found on <a href="https://github.com/fiedlr">GitHub</a>.
  When it comes to research, I'm primarily interested in mathematical logic and formal verification.
  This website aims to share some of my readable ideas with the world.
  I do not expect many people to read my posts, so take it as my public notebook.

  If you are intrigued by what I do or have any questions, I would be more than glad to hear from you!
  Just drop me an <a href="mailto:info@fiedlr.sk">e-mail</a> or tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/fiedlr">@fiedlr</a>.
  You can also find more information in my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/fiedlr">CV</a>.
