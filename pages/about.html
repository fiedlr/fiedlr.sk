title: About
---

<p>I like to write. Whether it is writing poetry, short stories, essays, mathematical proofs, or coding <em>a bit</em>, it does not really matter to me. My published software projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/fiedlr">GitHub</a>. The point of this site, on the other hand, is to share some of my readable ideas with the world. I do not expect that many people will be interested, take it as my public notebook.</p>

<p>Right now I am not focused on anything particular besides finishing my studies at <a href="https://www.fi.muni.cz">FI MUNI</a>. When it comes to Computer Science, I am mostly interested in formal verification and the theory of programming languages. My three programming languages of choice would be Haskell, TypeScript and C++ (in order). Recently I've grown very fond of <em>logic</em>, proof checking and <a href="https://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, my interests are too broad, sometimes I wish it was to the contrary. More information can be found in my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/fiedlr">CV</a>. If you had been intrigued by what I do, an unlikely event happened and I would be more than glad to hear from you! Just drop me an <a href="mailto:info@fiedlr.sk">e-mail</a> or tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/fiedlr">@fiedlr</a>.</p>
