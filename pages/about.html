<p>
  I like to write.
  Whether it is essays, mathematical proofs, poetry, or <em>code</em>.
  My published software projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/fiedlr">GitHub</a>.
  The point of this site, on the other hand, is to share some of my readable ideas with the world.
  I do not expect that many people will read my posts, so take it as my public notebook.
</p>

<p>
  I studied Theoretical Computer Science at <a href="https://www.fi.muni.cz">Masaryk University</a>.
  When it comes to research, I am mostly interested in formal verification and the theory of programming languages.
  My favorite programming languages are Haskell and TypeScript.
  Recently I've grown very fond of <em>logic</em>, proof checking, and <a href="https://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a>.

  Overall, my interests are too broad, sometimes I wish it was to the contrary.
  More information can be found in my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/fiedlr">CV</a>.
  If you had been intrigued by what I do, an unlikely event happened and I would be more than glad to hear from you!
  Just drop me an <a href="mailto:info@fiedlr.sk">e-mail</a> or tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/fiedlr">@fiedlr</a>.
